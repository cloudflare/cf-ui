# cf-ui

> Cloudflare UI Framework

cf-ui is a set of over 50 packages used to build UIs at Cloudflare using
projects such as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Fela](http://fela.js.org), [Lerna](https://lernajs.io) and more.

## Usage

Whilst cf-ui is used extensively within Cloudflare, it is also an evolving set of components and therefore can be unstable. **We recommend only using this toolset to build interfaces for Cloudflare-internal products.** However, feel free to follow along and contribute as we continue to grow this library.

## cf-ui meets CSS in JS

We are currently migrating cf-ui to CSS in JS powered by [Fela](https://github.com/rofrischmann/fela). That means that our components include styles written in JavaScript and you can use them out of the box! However, you need to start using Fela in your project. [Follow our migration here](https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-ui/issues/100).

## Getting Started

To view all of the available components and packages, see the [`packages/` directory](packages). Do you want to see examples? Check out our [documentation](https://cloudflare.github.io/cf-ui/).

## CSS in JS setup

cf-ui components expect that there is [Fela Renderer](http://fela.js.org/docs/basics/Renderer.html) in the context of your React app. It's the way how to render styles that come with our components into the `<style></style>` node. **You have to use Fela in your project if you want to use cf-ui.** Here's the code example how:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { StyleProvider } from 'cf-style-provider';
import { Button } from 'cf-component-button';

ReactDOM.render(
  <StyleProvider>
    <Button type="primary" onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>
      Primary Button
    </Button>
  </StyleProvider>,
  document.getElementById('react-app')
);
```

Do you want to try for yourself?

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cloudflare/cf-ui.git
cd cf-ui/packages/example
npm install
npm run build
open index.html
```
